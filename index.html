                        <h3>Filters, which began as cute puppy dog ears and love heart eyes, have now evolved into
                            face, eye and skin color transforming toolkits for the everyday user. Bigger and
                            brighter eyes, pointed nose, high cheekbones and filled lips, without any face fat, eye
                            bags, wrinkles, acne or spots — Take a selfie, apply a filter, post it on Instagram. It
                            is so simple and instant to show ourselves to the world, even though digital, as part of
                            what is called conventional beauty standards. We all want to feel beautiful and
                            desirable. Or sometimes we just want to hide our real appearance with filters that
                            disfigure our face in a very funny way. We can even use piercings and tattoos by simply
                            taking a filtered selfie. What was supposed to be ‘fun’ have now become a serious
                            subject that needs to be talked about. The sad and worrying part of this is that filters
                            basically diminish everything organic about our faces, our real faces, and we use it so
                            frequently that we reach a point where we don’t like our original face anymore. The term
                            facial dysmorphia comes under a mental health condition called Body Dysmorphic Disorder
                            (BBD) in which a person spends hours and hours thinking about their minor or socially
                            perceived physical flaws, whether skin imperfections, weight or a crooked smile. We live
                            in times that likes are the new currency and achieving flawless seems to help in that
                            regard. <strong>It’s time to say no and to get unfiltered because we are in our skin for
                                life,
                                not for likes.</strong></h3>

                            could be an influencer or someone who spends a lot of time on social networks and on
                            Instagram, and who, despite being beautiful, keeps feeling the need to be even more
                            beautiful or to transform her appearance in several ways— that is the height of the impact
                            that filters have on today's society.
